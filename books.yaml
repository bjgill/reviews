  title: The Way of Kings, part 1
  author: Brandon Sanderson
  date: 2017-04-17
  thoughts: 
    It is perhaps a little unfair to judge the work only having read book 1 - the author himself states that the division is somewhat arbitrary. In particular, far too many loose plot threads are left dangling, with nary a satisfactory resolution in sight.
    The book reminded me of _Game of Thrones_ (GoT) and _Wheel of Time_. The cast list is not (yet) as excessive, though. We stay longer with each protagonist than in GoT, but this only serves to make the jumps more discordant to me.
    That being said, it was quite a fun read, with Sanderson having many interesting concepts. In particular, I'm interested to see further explorations of gender roles in the setting. I've got the sequel on reserve at the library.

  title: The Handmaids Tale

    Really good; an interesting and thought-provoking read.
    I found the character of Luke (the protagonist's husband) particularly relevant. Following the government's suspension of womens' rights, he sought to reassure the protagonist - "you know I'll always take care of you". This seemed to me to represent the way in which those of greater priviledge can be blind to the difficulties of those of lesser priviledge, and the great hurt that causes. To assert that it will be alright, not to ask whether. To acquise to discrimination that did not affect them personally...

    Certainly well written, but I wasn't really able to discern any particular theme.

  title: A Vindication of the Rights of Women
  author: Mary Wollstonecraft

  thoughts: 
    (an interim thought now) very wordy, but perhaps that is just natural for the period? The terrible sexism and dehumanising effect of 'traditional Victorian' attitudes to women (all too many of which persist today, albeit thankfully in lesser form).
