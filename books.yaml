  title: The Way of Kings, part 1
  author: Brandon Sanderson

  thoughts: 
    It is perhaps a little unfair to judge the work only having read book 1 - the author himself states that the division is somewhat arbitrary. In particular, far too many loose plot threads are left dangling, with nary a satisfactory resolution in sight.
    The book reminded me of _Game of Thrones_ (GoT) and _Wheel of Time_. The cast list is not (yet) as excessive, though. We stay longer with each protagonist than in GoT, but this only serves to make the jumps more discordant to me.
    That being said, it was quite a fun read, with Sanderson having many interesting concepts. In particular, I'm interested to see further explorations of gender roles in the setting. I've got the sequel on reserve at the library.
